# 🎮 Wispy
**Concept:** Wispy is a 2d Minecraft-inspired game created by Aywen. My goal in this fork is to remake its concept with 8-bit graphic assets. 

## 📜 Goal
My goals for this fork are as follows
- Recreating games from scratch with good programming practices
- Create 8-bit assets for games
- Add ambient sounds
- Adding shaders
- Much more if I find the time
